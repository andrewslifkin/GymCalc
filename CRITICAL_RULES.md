.CRITICAL_RULES

[CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS]

These rules are non-negotiable:

You MUST address the user as "Andrew" at the start of every response. Absolutely NO exceptions.

Keep code secure, simple, non-redundant, and production-ready. Always prioritize maintainability and performance.

Consistently uphold best practices in architecture, security, and clarity.

After EACH code implementation or set of changes:
1. You MUST append an entry above the latest entry and below the dashed line separator in THIS file (`.CRITICAL_RULES`).
2. Entry MUST include:
   - Current timestamp
   - Summary of tasks completed
   - Any errors encountered
   - Debugging attempts if applicable

3. Format:
```
[TIMESTAMP]
Tasks done:
- [list of tasks]

Errors:
- [list of errors or "None"]

Debugging:
- [debugging steps or "N/A"]
```

4. Failure to append after EACH implementation indicates a critical error in following instructions.

Additional production-focused guidelines:

- Validate all inputs to prevent injection or unsafe operations.
- Store secrets and configuration in environment variables (avoid hard-coded credentials).
- Ensure thorough error handling and logging at each critical operation.
- Maintain automated tests (unit, integration) to enforce quality and catch regressions.
- Use consistent code formatting, linting, and continuous integration checks.
- Provide graceful fail-safes to handle unexpected behavior without crashing.

struct IncrementMode: Hashable {
    let id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var smallIncrement: Double
    var largeIncrement: Double
    var hapticIntensity: HapticIntensity
    
    static let defaultModes: [IncrementMode] = [
        .init(name: "Standard", smallIncrement: 0.5, largeIncrement: 2.5, hapticIntensity: .medium),
        .init(name: "Fine", smallIncrement: 0.25, largeIncrement: 1.25, hapticIntensity: .light),
        .init(name: "Coarse", smallIncrement: 1.0, largeIncrement: 5.0, hapticIntensity: .strong)

[2025-01-19T17:37:20+01:00]
Weight Adjustment Sensitivity Improvement Strategies:

Problem Analysis:
- Current gesture-based weight adjustment lacks fine-grained control
- Users find it challenging to make precise weight increments
- Potential usability barrier for detailed workout tracking

Proposed Solutions:
1. Adaptive Gesture Sensitivity
   - Implement variable increment sizes based on gesture speed/magnitude
   - Slow, gentle gestures = smaller increments
   - Faster, more pronounced gestures = larger increments

2. Multi-Stage Increment Approach
   - Introduce different increment levels:
     a. Fine adjustment (0.1 kg/0.25 lbs)
     b. Standard adjustment (0.5 kg/1 lbs)
     c. Large adjustment (2.5 kg/5 lbs)
   - Use gesture characteristics or additional UI controls to switch between modes

3. Precision Mode Toggle
   - Add a "Precision Mode" button/switch
   - When activated, reduces gesture sensitivity
   - Provides a dedicated interface for exact weight input

4. Velocity-Based Scaling
   - Calculate gesture velocity
   - Map velocity to a non-linear increment scale
   - Provide more control at lower speeds, allow quick jumps at higher speeds

5. Haptic Feedback Guidance
   - Use different vibration patterns to indicate:
     a. Increment size
     b. Precision of adjustment
   - Help users understand their gesture's impact

Recommended Implementation Strategy:
- Combine Adaptive Gesture Sensitivity with Multi-Stage Increment Approach
- Prioritize user experience and intuitive interaction
- Provide clear visual and haptic feedback

Technical Considerations:
- Leverage UIGestureRecognizer subclasses
- Implement custom gesture handling
- Use CoreHaptics for nuanced feedback
- Ensure performance optimization

User Experience Goals:
- Make weight adjustment feel natural and precise
- Reduce cognitive load during workout tracking
- Support various user preferences and interaction styles

Potential Challenges:
- Balancing complexity with simplicity
- Avoiding overwhelming users with too many options
- Maintaining consistent performance across different device sizes

        let currentWeight = weight(for: currentUnit)
        let alternateUnit = currentUnit == .lbs ? .kg : .lbs
        let alternateWeight = weight(for: alternateUnit)
        
        return String(format: "%.1f %@ (%.1f %@)", 
                      currentWeight, currentUnit.rawValue,

    // Core property initialization
    self.coreProperties = ...
    
    // UserDefaults handling
    self.dynamicProperties = retrieveOrDefault()
}

// View Decomposition
var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
        List {
            section1
            section2
            section3
        }
        .navigationModifiers
    }
}

private var section1: some View {

        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(id, forKey: .id)
        try container.encode(name, forKey: .name)
        try container.encode(smallIncrement, forKey: .smallIncrement)
    }
    
    // Robust Decodable initialization
    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        
        // Fallback mechanisms
        id = try container.decodeIfPresent(UUID.self, forKey: .id) ?? UUID()
        name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)
        smallIncrement = try container.decodeIfPresent(Double.self, forKey: .smallIncrement) ?? 0.5
    }
    
    // Strict coding keys
